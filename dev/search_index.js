What started off as a personal toy project trying to re-construct the K-Means algorithm in native Julia blew up after a heated discussion on the Julia Discourse forum when I asked for Julia optimization tips. Long story short, Julia community is an amazing one! Andrey offered his help and together, we decided to push the speed limits of Julia with a parallel implementation of the most famous clustering algorithm. The initial results were mind blowing so we have decided to tidy up the implementation and share with the world as a maintained Julia pacakge.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Say hello to ParallelKMeans!","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"This package aims to utilize the speed of Julia and parallelization (both CPU & GPU) to offer an extremely fast implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm and its variants via a friendly interface for practioners.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"In short, we hope this package will eventually mature as the \"one-stop-shop\" for everything K-Means on CPUs and GPUs.","category":"page"},{"location":"#K-Means-Algorithm-Implementation-Notes","page":"Home","title":"K-Means Algorithm Implementation Notes","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Since Julia is a column major language, the input (design matrix) expected by the package must be in the following format;","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Design matrix X of size n×m, the i-th column of X (X[:, i]) is a single data point in n-dimensional space.\nThus, the rows of the design matrix represent the feature space with the columns representing all the training samples in this feature space.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"One of the pitfalls of K-Means algorithm is that it can fall into a local minima.
